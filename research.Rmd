**Simultaneous elections and electoral outcomes: evidence from Italy**

*Abstract*: This paper investigates the impact that the simultaneity of national and local elections has on the local electoral stage, in terms of civic and political participation, political competition and electoral results. Methodologically, I employ a difference-in-differences design that exploits the staggered nature of the local elections in Italy, where some municipalities experience the simultaneity, while the rest do not. Voters' participation is positively impacted, with homogeneous effects along the gender dimension. Political participation mildly increases, while its competition is affected in an opposite way. Mayors winning in this simultaneous setting are more likely to have previous office experience. Lastly, using the simultaneity as a sample restriction, I document the existence of a split-ticket voting behaviour. In this regard, I find support for the divided government hypothesis as a mechanism.

**Social capital and the power of mafia**, *with* <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/francescacalamunci/home?authuser=0" target="_blank">*Francesca Calamunci*</a>

*Abstract*: What is the long-term effect of organised crime presence on social capital? This study combines multiple historical data sources, especially novel ones related to social capital and organised crime, to study this the relationship. Focusing on the expansion of criminal organisation in the Centre-North of Italy, we provide two alternative empirical identification strategies, based on an instrumental variable approach. First, we exploit a law ("*soggiorno obbligato*") that forced organised crime members living in the South of Italy to resettle in the Centre-North area. Second, we exploit the combination of migratory movements from the South to the Centre-North and the allocation of Marshall plan funds. Primarily employing a measure of tax compliance, which proxies for civic awareness, estimates show that long-term exposure to mafia presence depresses the social capital accumulation.

*Abstract*: How do political leaders’ cues affect citizen behavior regarding a new and complex issue? We address this question in the context of the early stages of the Covid‐19 pandemic in Mexico, using electoral outcomes and municipal‐level mobility data from Facebook's Movement Range Maps. In March 2020, Mexico's president downplayed constantly the severity of the coming health crisis by continuing his political rallies throughout the country and encouraging people to leave their homes. Using an event‐study analysis, we find that, after the first press conference where his government declared mobility restrictions were not yet necessary, on March 13, citizens’ geographic mobility in pro‐government municipalities was higher than in cities where support for the president was less strong. Our results are robust to several specifications and definitions of political support. Moreover, we find evidence that our results are driven by cities with higher media penetration, which implies that they can be attributed to people's reactions to the president's cues rather than to systematic differences in the preferences of his supporters.
