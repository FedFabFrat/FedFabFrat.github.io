**Simultaneous elections and electoral outcomes: evidence from Italy**

*Abstract*: This paper investigates the impact that the simultaneity of national and local elections has on the local electoral stage. Specifically, I focus on how this simultaneity impacts the local civic engagement, the political participation, the political competition and the electoral results. Methodologically, I employ a difference-in-differences design that exploits the staggered nature of the local elections in Italy, where some municipalities experience the simultaneity, while the rest do not. I find that the simultaneity affects the voters' participation positively, as well as the political participation and competition. Then, I find that the national success achieved by the right coalition spills over at the local level, both in terms of the votes share and of the ruling of the local government. Lastly, I document the existence of a split-ticket voting behaviour. Exploiting the simultaneity as a sample restriction, I find that a relevant percentage of municipalities engage in split-ticket voting behaviour on the local-national dimension. I find support for the divided government hypothesis as a possible mechanism.

**Social capital and the power of mafia**, *with* <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/francescacalamunci/home?authuser=0" target="_blank">*Francesca Calamunci*</a>

*Abstract*: What is the long-term effect of organized crime presence on social capital? This study combines multiple historical data sources to investigate the relationship between long-term exposure to organised crime’s activities and social capital.
Focusing on the expansion of criminal organization in the North of Italy, we provide two alternative empirical identification strategies, based on an instrumental variable approach. First, we exploit a law ("*Soggiorno obbligato*") that forced organized crime members living in the South of Italy to resettle in the Centre-North area. Second, we exploit the combination of migratory movements from the South to the Centre-North and the allocation of Marshall plan funds. Employing a set of outcomes that proxy for social capital, estimates show that long-term exposure to mafia presence depresses the social capital accumulation

*Abstract*: How do political leaders’ cues affect citizen behavior regarding a new and complex issue? We address this question in the context of the early stages of the Covid‐19 pandemic in Mexico, using electoral outcomes and municipal‐level mobility data from Facebook's Movement Range Maps. In March 2020, Mexico's president downplayed constantly the severity of the coming health crisis by continuing his political rallies throughout the country and encouraging people to leave their homes. Using an event‐study analysis, we find that, after the first press conference where his government declared mobility restrictions were not yet necessary, on March 13, citizens’ geographic mobility in pro‐government municipalities was higher than in cities where support for the president was less strong. Our results are robust to several specifications and definitions of political support. Moreover, we find evidence that our results are driven by cities with higher media penetration, which implies that they can be attributed to people's reactions to the president's cues rather than to systematic differences in the preferences of his supporters.
