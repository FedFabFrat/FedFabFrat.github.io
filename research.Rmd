**Simultaneous Elections and Voting Determinants: Empirical Evidence from Italy**

*Abstract*: This paper focuses on the relationship between local and national elections, and the related voter behaviour. Specifically, I address two questions. Firstly, I focus on how national election impact the local ones in terms of electoral results and political participation. Methodologically, I employ a difference-in-differences design that exploits the staggered nature of the local elections in Italy, where some municipalities experience the simultaneity between local and national elections, while the rest do not. I find that the simultaneity of the two elections affects the local voters’ turnout positively, as well as increasing political competition. Moreover, the simultaneity affects the local electoral results as well. Secondly, I document the existence of a split-voting behaviour in local and national elections. Specifically, exploiting the simultaneity as a sample restriction, I quantify this occurrence, and inspect its determinants from an economic point of view.

**Organised Crime, Public Procurement and Firms**, *with Decio Coviello and Nicola Mastrorocco*

*Abstract*: What is the impact of criminal organisations on the legal economy? This paper investigates this question by studying the effect of the collusion between organised crime and local politicians in the South of Italy. In order to capture the presence of organised crime, we exploit the staggered enforcement of a
national law allowing the dissolution of a municipal government upon evidence of collusion between elected officials and the mafia. We then measure the consequences ofthis collusion by using unique data on public procurements and firms. Difference-in-differences estimates reveal that infiltrated governments present less bidding firms, lower average rebates and are more likely to have non-public negotiations. Results are heterogeneous across procurement macro-categories and political party colours. Moreover, firms winning a procurement contract in a captured municipality exhibit an increase in profits, labour, a reduction in
capital, leaving unaffected total factor productivity.

**Setting an example: political leaders’ cues and health behavior in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico**, *with Bruno Morando and Luciano Ayala*

*__Forthcoming, Latin American Policy__*

*Abstract*: How do political leaders’ cues affect citizen’ behavior regarding a new and complex issue? We address this question in the context of the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic in Mexico, using electoral outcomes and municipal-level mobility data from Facebook’s Movement Range Maps. In March 2020, Mexico’s president constantly downplayed the severity of the coming health crisis, by continuing his political rallies throughout the country, and encouraging people to leave their homes. Using an event-study analysis, we find that, after the first press conference where his government declared mobility restrictions were not
yet necessary, on March 13 th, citizens’ geographic mobility in pro-government
municipalities was higher than in cities where support for the president was less strong. Our results are robust to several specifications and definitions of political support. Moreover, we find suggestive evidence that our results are driven by cities with higher media penetration, which implies that they can be attributed to people’s reactions to the president’s cues rather than to
systematic differences in the preferences of his supporters.
